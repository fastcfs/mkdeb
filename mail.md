Hello,

Unfortunately your package "libfastcommon" was rejected
because of the following reason:

Dsc failed to parse

dsc is missing from changes
Make sure you include the full source (if you are using sbuild make sure to use the --source option or the equivalent configuration item; if you are using dpkg-buildpackage directly use the default flags or -S for a source only upload)

Please try to fix it and re-upload. Thanks,
